ReelSync System Architecture

Overview
ReelSync is a client-server application with a modular architecture:
-Frontend: User interface for team collaboration  
-Backend:API server for business logic and data management  
-Database: Stores scripts, tasks, schedules, and media files

 Frontend
Tech: React.js + TailwindCSS  
Purpose:Interfaces for script editing, task boards, calendars, and chat  
Communication: REST API via Axios or WebSockets for real-time updates

Backend
Tech: Node.js + Express  
Purpose: Handles authentication, data requests, team collaboration logic, and file management

API Structure
- `/api/auth` → Login / Register / Team management  
- `/api/scripts` → Manage scripts and versioning  
- `/api/tasks` → Create and update shot lists, tasks, schedules  
- `/api/media` → Upload, view, and organize media files  
- `/api/chat` → Team messaging and notifications  

Database 
Collections:
- `users` — team members, roles, and permissions  
- `projects` — film projects and their details  
- `scripts` — versioned scripts per project  
- `tasks` — shot lists, schedules, task status  
- `media` — storyboards, clips, and reference files  
- `chat` — messages, channels, and notifications  

 Authentication Flow
1. Team member logs in  
2. Server issues JWT token  
3. Frontend stores token in local storage  
4. Token validates all future requests
