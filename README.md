# Reelsync
A collaborative film discovery tool
ReelSync is a simple digital workspace for movie production teams.  
It helps producers, directors, and crew members manage shoot schedules, share behind-the-scenes updates, and keep everyone in sync all in one place.

## Why it matters
Film projects often involve multiple departments wardrobe, camera crew, actors, logistics and communication easily gets messy across WhatsApp groups or spreadsheets.  
ReelSync organizes everything in one shared platform so teams can save time, avoid confusion, and keep production running smoothly.

## Who it’s for?
- **Producers** who want a birds-eye view of each day’s shoot.  
- **Directors and crew leads** who need to track scenes and resources.  
- **Production assistants** managing callsheets and updates.  
- **Studios** coordinating multiple film projects.

## Key Features
 **Smart Schedule Board** – Visual daily plan for shoots, cast, and crew.  
 **File Hub** – Central folder for scripts, BTS images, and equipment checklists.  
 **Instant Updates** – Real-time notifications when a task changes.  
 **Role-Based Access** – Keep sensitive details secure by team role.  
 **AI Scene Tracker** *(optional)* – Uses script keywords to auto-suggest shoot logistics.

## Technologies (Planned)
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)  
- **Storage:** Cloudinary for media files  

## Why ReelSync Stands Out
Unlike traditional project tools like Trello or Google Sheets, ReelSync is purpose-built for movie production with built-in fields for cast lists, shoot days, and media uploads.

## How to Try It
1. Visit the demo link (coming soon).  
2. Sign up as a *Producer* or *Crew Member*.  
3. Create your first film project.  
4. Upload a schedule, invite teammates, and start collaborating.

## Project Status
 In development :core structure and architecture defined.
